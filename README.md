## General Information
Background: This project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data to derive insights into usage patterns and factors influencing demand. By leveraging linear regression techniques, the goal is to build a predictive model for bike rentals, aiding in resource optimization and service planning.
Business Problem: The primary business problem addressed is the efficient management of bike-sharing resources. Understanding the key factors influencing bike rentals can help optimize bike availability, enhance user experience, and ultimately drive operational efficiency.
Dataset: The analysis is based on a dataset containing information on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week, among others, influencing bike-sharing activities.


## Conclusions
Conclusion 1: The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between temperature and bike rentals, indicating that warmer weather tends to result in increased usage.
Conclusion 2: Days with clear weather exhibit higher bike rental numbers compared to days with snow or mist, highlighting the impact of weather conditions on user behavior.
Conclusion 3: Time-based analysis suggests peak bike usage during specific hours, offering insights into when the service is most in demand.
Conclusion 4: Certain days of the week show a consistent pattern of high or low bike rentals, contributing to a better understanding of weekly usage trends.
